		<p>Source code download and source documentation of Moody is unavailable for the moment. The current codebase is undergoing some significant changes and improvements, and much of the existing documentation and tutorial content does not reflect those changes, which could lead to confusion.</p>
		<p>The demonstration builds are still available, and the source code will be made available once more when I've finished version 1.5 and updated the rest of the content on the site. I anticipate this will be in the next week (as in the first week of October)</p>
	<p>I'm working hard on this right now, promise!</p>
