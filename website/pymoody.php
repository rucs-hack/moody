	<h2>pyMoody - the Python library build of Moody</h2>	
	<h3>building pyMoody</h3>
	<p>open a terminal and cd to the pymoody folder in the main moody distribution, - moody/pymoody/.</p>
	<p>rune compile.sh, you may need to chmod+x it first.</p>
	<p>if all has gone well and pyMoody is compiled, try running 'python moody.py'. This is a python version of the demonstration model provided with the main moody code.</p>
	<p>pyMoody has all the features and capabilities of reguler moody. There is no dedicated source documentation for it yet, so you should use the doxygen source code documentation listed in the menu for now.</p>
	<p>This page will hopefully get more interesting later.</p>
